The MailRoom application is a Java program designed for managing various types of mail items. Developed as part of an assignment for CSE 1322L during the Fall 2023 term, the application allows users to handle letters, flats, regular boxes, and live boxes. Each type of mail item is validated against specific criteria before being added to a delivery queue. Users can then dispatch the queued items for delivery. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and input handling in Java.
